Web Scraping uses intelligence automation methods to get thousands or even millions of 
data sets in a smaller amount of time.Web Scripting is an automatic method to obtain large 
amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format 
which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be 
used in various applications. Web scraping requires two parts namely the crawler and the 
scraper. The crawler is an artificial intelligence algorithm that browses the web to search the 
particular data required by following the links across the internet. The scraper, on the other 
hand, is a specific tool created to extract the data from the website. The design of the 
scraper can vary greatly according to the complexity and scope of the project so that it can 
quickly and accurately extract the data.

In this project, we used WEB SCRAPER to make a DICTIONARY. Here we worked with 
PYTHON to scrape data from a site "https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/". We worked 
with a library of python called BEAUTIFUL SOUP to extract data.
